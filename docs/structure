This app can be divided into some modules (not AngularJS like modules):

1 - Database - It will be implemented using SQLite, which is light and has many implemented interfaces in various programming and scripting languages, like PHP and Python.

2 - Data import - It will be implemented using Python. The main goal here is to be able to import data from bank statements, credit card bills etc.

3 - GUI - It will be implemented as a web application, using HTML 5, CSS 3, AngularJS and PHP. The following aspects will be available:
    -> Data importing
    -> Raw data presentation (tables from database)
    -> Graphs (spendings, earnings, savings, interests etc.)
    -> More to come...
